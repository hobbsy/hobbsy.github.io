Here are some notes on my attempts to install **Arch Linux** on my ThinkPad.

This page is a work in progress...

I am mostly following the YouTube video tutorial by GloriousEggroll: 
- [2017 Arch Linux EFI Install Guide][install-guide] (uploaded 20th Aug 2017)

plus the [blogpost][blogpost-url] by the same author (which has received some updates since his 2017 video went live). 

I have the [official Arch Linux wiki install guide][arch-wiki-install] open as another reference.

I have also been following Luke Smith's various YouTube videos on installing Arch:

- [Install Artix or Arch Linux (Encrypted system)][luke-smith-yt1] (uploaded 3rd Feb 2023)
- [Full Arch Linux Install (SAVAGE Edition!)][luke-smith-yt2] (uploaded 8th March 2018)
- [After a Minimal Linux Install: Graphical Envionment and Users][luke-smith-yt3] (uploaded 21st April 2018)
